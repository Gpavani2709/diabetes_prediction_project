📝 Project Description:
This repository contains the solution for Task 3: End-to-End Data Science Project as part of the CodTech Internship. The main objective of this task was to create a complete machine learning pipeline starting from EDA and preprocessing to model deployment using Flask and Streamlit.

The project focuses on predicting diabetes based on patient features such as Glucose, BMI, Age, etc., using a supervised learning algorithm (Random Forest Classifier). It also includes a deployed Flask REST API and a Streamlit web app to interactively test the model.

⚙️ Workflow:
✅ 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzed trends and relationships using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. Identified patterns and null values.

✅ 2. Model Building:
A Random Forest Classifier was trained on the cleaned and preprocessed data. Model accuracy was evaluated using train-test split and accuracy score.

✅ 3. Model Saving:
Used pickle to serialize and save the trained model as model.pkl.

✅ 4. API Development (Flask):
Built a simple Flask server (main.py) with a /predict endpoint that receives patient data and returns diabetes prediction as JSON.

✅ 5. Web UI (Streamlit):
Developed an intuitive front-end using Streamlit (app.py) to accept user inputs and display prediction results interactively.

✅ 6. Deployment (Streamlit Cloud):
The project was deployed on Streamlit Cloud for public access and demonstration.
